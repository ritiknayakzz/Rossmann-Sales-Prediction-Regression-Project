# Rossmann-Sales-Prediction-Regression-Project

The Capstone project is based on regression on Rossmann sales dataset. Two
datasets have been provided for this project. The first dataset is pertaining to the
historic sales of the company while the second dataset gives some additional
information on each distinct store. While the first dataset has 1,017,209 records
spread across 9 variables, the second dataset has 1,115 records (for 1,115 distinct
stores) spread across 10 variables.

The following steps are involved in the project:

1. A preliminary/exploratory analysis of each distinct feature present in both
the datasets. For the variables in the first dataset, a bivariate analysis also
was done between the variable at hand and the sales variable. Graphical
demonstrations were made in both raw and transformed data - when
required.

2. The missing values were dealt with. Some features were removed after
deep analysis while others were imputed using appropriate techniques.

3. Feature engineering was done. A few new features were created and
analyzed appropriately.

4. Two ML techniques - Linear regression using OLS and regression using
Decision tree - were employed. The percentage change in RMSE was used
as baseline and a hyperparameter was tuned in the Decision tree.
